## About the Video Course
This is the most comprehensive beginner course on Unity 3d on the Internet. We are avid game developers and were tired of all the junk out there - teaching students how to make 3D cubes without real-world game development. In this course, you’ll learn how to use Unity 3D. This course gently eases them into Unity development while providing the excitement of creating a working project, even if they’re unfamiliar with coding or the Unity IDE.
